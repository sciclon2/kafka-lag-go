## [v2.0.2] - Redis Authentication, Authorization, and TLS Support (10th Sept 2024)

### Feat
- **Redis AuthN/AuthZ and TLS Support**: Added support for Redis authentication (AuthN) and authorization (AuthZ) using ACLs (available from Redis 6.0+). This enables users to provide usernames and passwords for secure access to Redis instances.
- **Redis TLS Support**: Introduced TLS encryption for Redis connections, allowing secure communication between Kafka Lag Go and Redis clusters.
- **Backward Compatibility**: These features maintain full backward compatibility, supporting unsecured Redis instances for users who prefer non-encrypted connections.

### Documentation
- **Redis Setup Guide**: Updated the Redis documentation to include configuration examples for setting up authentication, authorization, and TLS.
